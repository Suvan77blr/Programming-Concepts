Stacks

* LIFO.

* Operations : Push, Pop, Peek, Size, isEmpty.

* Advs : - easy implementation
    - efficient memory usage.
    - helpful in recursive logics.
    
* Disadvs : - limited access (only to top)
    - No random access.
    - No efficient search or sort.
    - Limited size.

* implementation : Arrays, Linked List, STL Stack container (all ops O(1))
